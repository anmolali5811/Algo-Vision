# Algorithm Visualizer   (https://anmolali5811.github.io/Algo-Vision/#/)

A better visualization of different algorithms made with React. 

  

So far there are 9 segments  
- Pathfinder
- Prime Numbers
- Sorting Algorithms
- N Queen
- Convex Hull
- Binary Search Game
- Recursion Tree
- Recursive Sorting
- 15 Puzzle


We have implemented a total of `20 algorithms` so far. And will try to add more later.
