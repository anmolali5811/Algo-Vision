# Algorithm Visualizer   (https://anmolali5811.github.io/Algo-Vision/#/)

A better visualization of different algorithms made with React. 

  

So far there are 7 segments  
- Pathfinder
- Prime Numbers
- Sorting Algorithms
- N Queen
- Convex Hull
- Binary Search Game
- Recursion Tree


I have implemented a total of `20 algorithms` so far. And will try to add more later.  

## Algorithms implemented 

- DFS
- BFS
- Dijkstra
- Recursive Maze Creation
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Heap sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Sieve of Eratosthenes
- Archimedes Spiral
- N Queen Backtracking
- Graham Scan for Convex Hull
- Binary Search
- Recursion
  - Fibonacci Number
  - Binomial Coefficient
  - Derangement
  - Fast Exponentiation
  - Stirling Number of Second Kind
