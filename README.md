# Algorithm Visualizer   (https://anmolali5811.github.io/Algo-Vision/#/)

A better visualization of different algorithms made with React. 

  

So far there are 7 segments  
- Pathfinder
- Prime Numbers
- Sorting Algorithms
- N Queen
- Convex Hull
- Binary Search Game
- Recursion Tree


I have implemented a total of `20 algorithms` so far. And will try to add more later.  

## Algorithms implemented 

- DFS
- BFS
- Dijkstra
- Recursive Maze Creation
-Sorting Algorithm
  - Bubble sort
  - Selection sort
  - Insertion sort
-Recursive Sorting
  - Heap sort
  - Merge sort
  - Quick sort
- Prime Sieve of Eratosthenes
- N Queen Backtracking
- Graham Scan for Convex Hull
- Binary Search
- Recursion
  - Fibonacci Number
  - Binomial Coefficient
  - Derangement
  - Bigmod
  - Stirling Number of Second Kind
